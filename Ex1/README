==================
=  Description:  =
==================
The exercise is divided into two different scripts.
In the first script name "hello_turtle.py"
I used the module "turtle" to print to the
standard output (screen) a draw of three flowers.
In the second script name "math_print.py"
I used the module "math" to define six different
printing functions to the result of mathematical
calculations according to the demand.

======================
=  Special Comments  =
======================
1.The script "hello_turtle.py" defined
to start printing as you run it.
2.The script "math_print.py" defined
to call all of the functions
included in it at the end of the script.
