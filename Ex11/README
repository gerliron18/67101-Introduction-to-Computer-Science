==================
The backtracking exercise goal is to solve problems using backtracking method.
As the name suggests we back­track to find the solution.
We start with one possible move out of many available moves
and try to solve the problem. if we are able to solve the problem
with the selected move then we will print the solution
else we will back­track and select some other move and try to solve it.
If none of the moves work out we will claim that there
is no solution for the problem.

This exercise separated to few parts:

Part one: ex11_backtrack.py
Define a general backtracking function that should solve few problems,
this function will be called from different programs to work with.

Part two: ex11_sudoku.py and ex11_map_coloring.py
Define programs that solve sudoku board and solve graph coloring problems
using the general backtracking function.

Part three: ex11_improve_backtrack.py
In this part we define function that should make the general backtracking
more efficient using few given methods.
