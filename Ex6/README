==================
=  Description:  =
==================
A program for image processing.
Including 8 base function for operations on images,
each one of them can relate to few more functions that helps the script
be much more readable:
1. Finding image threshold
2. Convert image pixels to B/W according to founded threshold
3. Applying image filter by given 3*3 filter matrix
4. Edge detector that apply filter by 8 nearest pixels average
5. *3 sampeling of given image
6. Downsameling image by max diagonal size user input
7. Find the dominate angle of given B/W image
8. Rotate image by a given angle
More over, there are few functions at the end of the script that use to manage
the all program:
1. Make correction - run all above function in their order to rotate given
   image by dominate angle of the image
2. Check the input - for checking the correction of given files
3. Main - this function is the top managing function, will call
   manage functions above to use all the program.
   When user call this program, this function starts automatically.

=  Special Comments  =
======================
# This project won't print anything to the interpreter
  but will form an output file according to user request.
# I chose to seperate the filter function and the edge function to eprox. 10
  function each because I think it's more efficiant than work with 1,2 or 3
  function that will check any pixel few times.
