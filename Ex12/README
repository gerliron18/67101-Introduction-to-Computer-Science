=  Description:  =
==================
This exercise is a Connect Four game which uses OOP coding,
graphical user interface,(GUI) computer networking and artificial intelligence
(AI).

Four In A Row / Connect Four is a two-player game in which
the players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The grid has seven
columns and six rows. When inserting a disk, the disk falls straight down,
occupying the next available spot within the column.
In order to win, a player must get four of their discs in a row. Whoever
gets four in a row first is the winner.
The name Four In A Row might be slightly misleading, since you can win also in
other situations, when the "row" is not the typical meaning of "row" (aka a
horizontal line). There are a three ways to get four disks in a row:
a horizontal row, a vertical row (column), and a diagonal sequence.

When it's your turn to make a move, you just have to press the
column you would like to drop your disc into. On your first move,
the disk will will drop all the way to the bottom row. You can put a disk
in any column you wish, unless the column is full.

To play the game, one can call the game from the command line. In the command
line, one must give a few arguments, including:
The type of player:
You can choose whether to play against the computer, by entering "ai" into the
command line. Alternately you can play against a friend (or enemy?!) by
entering "human" into the command line.
The port:
The port through which the networking will go through.
Server:
One of the players will serve as the "server" and will not give another
argument. In addition, he will be "Player One" and as such, he will be the
first to make a move. The other player or the computer will serve as the
"client" and will have to add an additional argument to the command line: the
server ip.

This game will work in all the possible combinations of player type:
Human vs human, human vs computer, and computer vs computer.

GUI:
Our GUI class is implemented inside the four_in_a_row.py script.
The GUI brings up indications about the current state of the game. These
include messages at the bottom of the window that show whose turn it is and
what your color disks are (yes... we've found that sometimes when you play
dozens of games in a row, it becomes challenging to remember what color you are
playing:)). Once there is a winning hand on the board, the circles that created
the "four in a row" change their color to indicate where the winning hand is,
and display a winning and losing message to the appropriate players.

AI:
One of the strategies of Connect Four is to place your disk in the center
column. Thus, when the AI needs to generate a move, it first tries to drop a
disk into the center column. If the column is full, then it randomly generates
another location into which he puts a disk.

Non of the scripts would print any to the screen when it called
correctly.
