=  Description:  =
==================
The main purpose of this exercise is working with conditions.
You will find a bundle of six python files:
1. convert_spoon_to_cup.py - script that define a function
   that gets parameters and return value
2. calculate_mathematical_expression.py - script that define a
   2 functions, one that gets parameters and return value
   and one that call the first function
3. largest_and_smallest.py - script that define a function
   that gets 3 parameters and return 2 values
4. quadratic_equation.py - script that define 2 functions,
   one that gets 3 coefficients of quadratic equation and
   then calculate it and one that gets an input from the
   user, call the first function and use it to print
   an answer to the user
5. shapes.py - script that define a function that gets
   values from the user and calculate the area of geometric
   shapes
6. temperature.py - script that define a function that gets
   4 parameters from the user and compare one to another
   then return boolean value

======================
None of the scripts ends with a call to one of the
functions in it as requested but one function can call
the other.
