==================
=  Description:  =
==================
A program that define 8 different function:

Part A - getting an input from the user:

1. "Create list"- the function return a list
   of the user inputs related one to the other.
2. "Concat list"- the function return the join of
   the given strings together.
3. "Average"- the function based on a list of floats,
   will return the average value.

Part B - Loops and Lists:

4. "Cyclic"- the function works with 2 lists from
   any kind, checks if one is the cyclic permutation
   of the other, will return a boolean True or False.
5. "Histogram"- the function return the histogram of
   a list according to a given integer as a list.

Part C - Nested Loops:

6. "Prime factors"- The function return a list of the
   prime factors of a given integer.
7. "Cartesian"- the function return a list of tuples
   represent the cartesian product of 2 given string lists.
8. "Pairs"- the function return a list of integer pairs
   from a given list that their amount equals a given integer.

Part D - Theoretical questions:

1. The function will return Flase boolean because the function
   compare between lists with few factors. This call compare
   between 2 lists of one factor each that are different strings.
2. The function will return an error. the given integer
   equals 3 while the given list include the integer '4'.
   Because 4 > 3, the for loop need to work out of her range
   where it not define so error will be.
3. The function will return an empty list. As it for the
   integer '1', the value '0' divide by any number excluding
   itself so at my function this case returns an empty list
   as it for integer '1'.
4. The function will return the list:
   [[0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [0, 2], [1, 1]].
   The integers '0' and '2' repeat 2 times each at the call,
   the function built to return any of the possible cases
   but wont check for pair repetitions. Because of this lack
   of check the output seems like that.

======================
This program define 8 functions but
wont call any of them.
