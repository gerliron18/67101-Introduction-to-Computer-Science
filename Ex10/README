==================
This exercise define functions working with binary trees,
OOP and recursion.

The main issue of this exercise is to work with a frame of classes,
there was 3 different classes that was created for us:
Node, Record and Diagnoser

In part one our purpose was to define functions in Diagnoser class that
could work with external data of illnesses and symptoms of sick people,
arrange them in trees and to find paths and comparing symptoms with
illnesses.

In part two we define functions that are not in class functions,
this part including building trees and calculate the lowest error rate
according to the data that the user gave us.
